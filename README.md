 # Airport Surface Traffic Control (ASTC) Simulation**

## Overview**

This project is an object-oriented simulation of airport surface traffic control (ASTC) developed in Java. It models the movement of airplanes on the ground, including taxiing, takeoffs, and landings, while managing potential conflicts and optimizing traffic flow.

## Key Features**

* Task-driven engine with priority queuing**
* Global clock synchronization**
* Core components:**
    * TaskEngine
    * SimulationClock
    * AirplaneList
    * Airplane Class
    * AirportGroundNetwork
    * ShortestPath Class
* Additional components (optional):
    * AirplaneFlightScheduler
    * AirfieldTrafficFlowAnimator
    * ControlLogic
    * TrafficParam

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites:
    * Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
    * A Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans)

2. Installation:
    * Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Running the Simulation:
    * Open the project in your IDE.
    * Locate the `main` class (usually in the `src` package).
    * Run the `main` class to start the simulation.

## Usage

* Configuration:
    * Adjust simulation parameters in the `TrafficParam` class (if applicable).
    * Define the airport ground network structure in the `AirportGroundNetwork` class.
* Observation:
    * Monitor the simulation output in the console (or a visual interface, if implemented).
    * Analyze airplane movements, traffic patterns, and potential conflicts.
* Experimentation:
    * Modify parameters and logic to explore different scenarios and strategies.
